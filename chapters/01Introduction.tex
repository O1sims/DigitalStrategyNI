\label{sec:aimMotivation}

\section{Overview of digital strategies across Europe}

\subsection{Denmark}

In January 2018, the Danish Government published a strategy on advancing the Danish digital economy. The Digital Growth Strategy aims at placing Denmark in front when it comes to exploring the opportunities offered by digitisation and new technology. The strategy contains 38 concrete initiatives, which aim to secure and enhance Denmarkâ€™s position as an attractive digital hub by providing a boost to the Danish tech ecosystem and improve conditions for businesses to be able to utilise the full benefits of new technologies.

Among the initiatives are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A digital hub with a matchmaking platform to improve companies' access to talents and competences within emerging digital technologies.
\item A more agile regulation on companies' opportunities to test new business models.
\item Introducing computational thinking in elementary school.
\item A digital solution for companies to report cyber security incidents.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sweden}

In 2017 the Swedish Government a digital strategy focussing on sustainable digital transformation of the Swedish economy. The Agenda set the policy objective and established a Government advisory committee (the `Digitisation Commission'). The Commission, chaired by Sweden's Digital Champion, was tasked by Government to promote the digital agenda objective and engage stakeholders and to develop an action achieving the policy objective and present this to Government.

The overall policy objective is for Sweden to become the world leader in harnessing the opportunities of digital transformation. The approach recognises the need for leadership and the need to monitor progress. Priorities include: Regulation for digital age; digital security; digtial skills; data innovation; digital infrastructure; and importance of national leadership and continuous analysis of digital maturity and the need of measures.

\subsection{Finland}

Every year the Finnish Government releases its action plan, which encompasses many aspects of the Finnish economy, including digitisation and experimentation. Finland has made a productive leap in public services and the private sector by harnessing the potential offered by digitisation, specifically in dismantling unnecessary regulation and cutting red tape. The flexible regeneration of Finnish society is supported by a management culture based on trust, interaction and experimenting.

The Government has a number of objectives for the priority areas of digitisation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Digitised public services. Public services are designed to be user-responsive and primarily digital. This is to be achieved by modernising practices and is crucial for achieving a productivity leap in public administration.
    \item Growth environment for digital business operations. The intention is to create a favourable operating environment for digital services and new business models. Specifically, big data and robotisation will be leveraged to create new businesses and practices.
    \item Streamlined legal provisions. The objective is to create enabling regulation, promoting deregulation and reducing administrative burden.
    \item Culture of experimenting. Experimentation will aim at innovative solutions, improvements in services, the promotion of individual initiative and entrepreneurship, and the strengthening of regional and local decisionmaking and cooperation.
    \item Better leadership and implementation. Government and central government management processes will be reconciled with the Government's strategy work. Knowledge-based management and implementation reaching across administrative branches will be strengthened.
\end{itemize}

\section{Current initiatives in Northern Ireland}

\subsection{Public sector}

\subsubsection{Department for the Economy (DfE)}

\paragraph{Academies}

\paragraph{Bring I.T. On}

\paragraph{Digital Northern Ireland 2020.}

The report initially describes the nature of the Northern Ireland Digital Platform and identifies those areas where it has the potential to positively impact progress, both in economic and social terms. It provides a top level review of the nature of opportunities across the various sectors, and identifies a set of concrete projects which could be launched in the year ahead, to create real momentum to the creation of a vibrant Knowledge Economy in Northern Ireland.

The report concludes with proposing the creation of a programme leadership role, which will be essential if the initiative is to achieve results and sets out a top level plan for the next three years

\paragraph{Open Data NI.}

Established as part of the Digital NI 2020 initiative (outlined above) and developed by the Open Data Team. The aim of the initiative is to provide easy access to data produced by the public sector. The aim is to allow the public, as well as researchers and developers, to gain socio-economic insights of Northern Ireland, as well as develop web apps and visulisations.

\subsubsection{Department for Education}

\subsection{Private sector}

\subsubsection{Allstate}

\subsubsection{BT}

\subsubsection{Calayst Inc.}

\paragraph{Springboard.} Springboard is an in-business initiative that challenges, supports and expedites robust business models, including sales and marketing strategies, by leveraging the collective knowledge of a unique network of experienced entrepreneurs and business leaders in an open, nurturing environment. The programme is open to companies with the ambition and potential to grow revenue to between \pounds 10 million and \pounds 100 million.

The programme is established to \emph{challenge}, \emph{support} and \emph{expediate} new businesses and products by: (a) providing a network of experienced people that stress-test product ideas and help to refine the proposition; (b) provide unconditional support; and (c) helping to establish a robust business model quickly.

\paragraph{Generation Innovation.} .

\paragraph{Invest.} An annual competition that showcases and rewards local innovations and proof of concept ideas that have the greatest commercial potential.

\paragraph{Co-founders.} Co-founders is a 10 week programme that brings together individuals and teams with experience and ideas to develop new business products and services.

\paragraph{CEOs Connect.} CEOs Connect is a peer-to-peer network supporting CEOs of high growth potential innovation companies in Northern Ireland as they scale and grow. The network allows members to develop relationships in confidence with other CEOs of innovation companies, share intelligence and networks, and grow and scale their companies and deal with any challenges they have.

\section{The future of work}

\subsection{AI, robotics, and automation}

The reality is that technology is developed not to replace jobs, skills and people, but to complement and assist people. AI and machine learning software is developed to help people solve problems. As AI and other technologies enter the workplace, skills such as critical thiking, creativity and problem-solving gain in importance. 

According to the 2018 Deloitte Human Capital Survey, almost half (47\%) of respondents say that their organisations are deeply involved in automation projects, with 24\% using AI and robotics to perform routine tasks, 16\% to augment human skills, and 7\% to restructure work entirely.

In terms of company expectations, 42\%  of respondents believe that AI will be widely developed at their organisations within three to five years--up from 38\% last year. Despite these expectations, many organisations may still be coming to grips with AI's potential uses. Indeed, a 2017 Deloitte survey of 1,500 senior executives found that only 17\% of them were familiar with both the concept of AI and its applications at their companies. Indeed, although many senior executives see this area as important, only a minority feel ready to address it.

In a 2018 Deloitte report on the future for technology, media, and telecommunications a prediction is made regarding the future of artificial intelligence. The headline is that AI technologies is moving from an expert-only domain to empowering everyday use. The exposure of new AI and machine learning tools needs to be complemented with correct appicable training of school-leavers and gaduates as well as the upskilling of current employees. Later in the paper we discuss the need for specific technical clusters; one of which in Cognative Technology, which embraces AI.
